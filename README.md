# aes128java
My implementation of the AES-128 algorithm in Java. Independent project.
<br>
Good demonstration of some of the more interesting things I learned in my Java course such as method overloading and abstract classes. Also contains things I learned on my own such as how the AES cipher works, how CBC encryption mode works, bitwise operations, and finite field arithmetic in Galois field 2^8.
